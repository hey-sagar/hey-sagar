<h1 align='center'>Hello There! I'm Shivam ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
<h2> I don't dislike spending a weekend writing code. </h2>
<h3> Some facts! </h3>
<ul>
  <li> I am currently working as a GenAI Tech Lead/Developer. </li>
  <li> GenAI assisted development will always be better than code entirely written by LLMs. </li>
  <li> Shipping product fast doesn't mean you can skimp out on writing good code. </li>
  <li> Just because most logical reasoning can be done with LLMs doesn't mean it should be. </li>
</ul>
